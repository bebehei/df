# my personal dotfiles

These are my personal dotfiles. Free for personal use.

## Installation

Execute the following tasks somewhere. It really shouldn't matter.


    git clone https://github.com/bebehei/df
    cd df
    ./deploy.sh

This will fetch some other submodules and symlink every configfile in the system.

It won't overwrite your config-files, but only replace symlinks.
